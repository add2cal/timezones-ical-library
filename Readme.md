# Add to Calendar TimeZones iCal Library

The tool to convert the [IANA (formerly Olson) timezone database files](http://www.iana.org/time-zones) into VTIMEZONE files compatible with the iCalendar specification (RFC2445).

It is based on the awesome tool by Damon Chaplin ([github.com/libical/vzic](https://github.com/libical/vzic)), but only provides the VTIMEZONE part to easily put this into any other iCal generator (like the [add-to-calendar-button](https://github.com/add2cal/add-to-calendar-button)). It is built to be used standalone or as JavaScript module, hosted as npm package.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation / Setup

### 1. Update it

**This step is only relevant if you want to build the package from source!**

(Requires Node.js as well as Linux as operating system.)

Simply run `sh update-tzdata.sh tzVersionNumber` with *tzVersionNumber* being the version of the timezone database you want to use (e.g. sh update-tzdata.sh 2022c).

<br />

### 2. Use it

There are 2-3 option how you can use the script.

1. You can use the VanillaJS version from the dist folder.
2. You can use the npm package via `npm install timezones-ical-library` and ...
  1. require the package (commonJS) or ...
  2. import the module (ES) via `import { tzlib_get_ical_block } from 'timezones-ical-library';`.

In all cases, you can then use the `tzlib_get_ical_block(tzName)` function, which returns the proper iCal VTIMEZONE block.
