# Add to Calendar TimeZones iCal Library

The tool to convert the [IANA (formerly Olson) time zone database files](http://www.iana.org/time-zones) into VTIMEZONE blocks, compatible with the iCalendar specification (RFC2445).

It is based on the awesome tool by Damon Chaplin ([github.com/libical/vzic](https://github.com/libical/vzic)), but only provides the VTIMEZONE part to easily put this into any other iCal generator (like the [add-to-calendar-button](https://github.com/add2cal/add-to-calendar-button)). It is built to be used standalone or as JavaScript module, hosted as npm package.

## üì¶ Installation / Setup

### 0. Update it (not required)

**This step is only relevant if you want to build the package and data on your own and from source!**
_(Requires Node.js as well as Linux as operating system.)_
Run ...

```
sudo sh update-tzdata.sh tzVersionNumber
```

... with _tzVersionNumber_ being the version of the [IANA time zone database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones) you want to use (e.g. sudo sh update-tzdata.sh 2022g).

<br />

### 1. Load it

Install the package via npm with:

```
npm install timezones-ical-library
```

After the installation:

- require the package (commonJS) or ...
- import the module (ES) via `import { tzlib_get_ical_block, tzlib_get_offset, tzlib_get_timezones } from 'timezones-ical-library';`.

<br />

### 2. Use it

#### A. Get time zones

Use `tzlib_get_timezones()` to retrieve a list of all available time zone strings. You can pass `true` to retrieve a JSON formatted string instead of an array.

#### B. Get the iCal time zone block

Use the `tzlib_get_ical_block(tzName)` function to return the proper iCal VTIMEZONE block for a given time zone string (tzName). Again, pass `true` to retrieve a JSON formatted string instead of an array (not recommended).

You will receive an array, holding the VTIMEZONE block first, and the TZID line (additionally) second. The latter one is needed for any further time statement.

Include this into your further iCal data to come up with a complete ics file.

A final constellation could look like this:

```

```

#### C. Get a specific offset

Use `tzlib_get_offset(tzName, isoDate, isoTime)` to get specific offset (relative to UTC), based on a provided date and time.

For example, you can provide _tzName_ `'Europe/Berlin'`, _isoDate_ `'2023-05-23'`, and _isoTime_ `'15:45'` in order to retrieve the offset, which applies for this time zone at the 23rd of May in 2023 at exactly 15:45.

## ‚öôÔ∏è API

Instead of using this code or the npm package, you could also make use of the free and open API.

### Getting a list of all zone names

```
https://tz.add-to-calendar-technology.com/api/zones.json
```

### Getting the ics part of a respective zone

```
https://tz.add-to-calendar-technology.com/api/%zoneName%.ics
```

With %zoneName% being your time zone. So, for New York, this would be [https://tz.add-to-calendar-technology.com/api/America/New_York.ics](https://tz.add-to-calendar-technology.com/api/America/New_York.ics).
**This is case sensitive!**

(Mind that this does not deliver a fully valid ics file, since it only contains the VTIMEZONE part. You will need to combine this with your other event information.)
